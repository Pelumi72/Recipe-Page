### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learnt how to style list markers. I further learnt how to style tables with bootstrap and normal CSS. This code I am proud of.

CSS
li::marker {
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%)
}

### Continued development

I would like to know if there are ways of repositioning table element with css .

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me with styling the marker and the table it gave a lot more information on styling tables and list markers.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This helped to finally realise how I would start to style the table element.
